# walk-run-and-jump
For this ThreeJS demo, we create a 3D character for game development using Blender for creating 3D animations and Mixamo for pre-generated model animations with multiple animations.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
# To install the dependencies for the ThreeJS 3D character demo, use npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
$ npm install

This command will install all necessary dependencies required for running the demo.

# Usage
$ npm run dev
This command will start a local server, and you can access the demo in your web browser.
```

## Functionality

### `Walking, Running, and Jumping:`
The 3D character in the demo can perform walking, running, and jumping animations based on keyboard input. Pressing the defined keys on the keyboard triggers these animations, and the character will remain idle when no keys are pressed.

### `Mouse Movement:`
The direction of the character changes based on the movement of the mouse. Moving the mouse left or right will cause the character to rotate accordingly.

### `Environment:`
The demo includes grass on the surface and a sky element to create a more realistic environment.

## Dependencies
The demo relies on the following dependencies:
Three.js: A JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser.


## Credits
Blender: Used for creating 3D animations and models.
Mixamo: Used for pre-generated model animations.

## Keyboard Event:
### `Key W:`
Press W key for walking.

### `Key R:`
Press R key for Run.

### `Key Spacebar:`
Press spacebar key for jumping.

## Mouse Event:
### `Left mouse click and move Left and Right:`
Click the left mouse button and change the mouse direction to the right and left, the model's direction will also change accordingly.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the creators and contributors of Three.js, Blender, and Mixamo for their fantastic tools and resources that made this demo possible.
